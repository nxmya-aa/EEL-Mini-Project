# SmartWaste — Advanced Multi-page Site
This package contains a multi-page frontend demo for the Smart Waste Management System (interactive dashboard, full content, and schematic).

## Folder structure

## How to run
1. Unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click). For best results (some browsers block local files), run a local server:
